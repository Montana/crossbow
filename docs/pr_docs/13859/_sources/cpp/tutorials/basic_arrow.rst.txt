===========================
Basic Arrow Data Structures
===========================

Apache Arrow provides fundamental data structures for representing data:
:class:`Array`, :class:`ChunkedArray`, :class:`RecordBatch`, and :class:`Table`. 
This article shows how to construct these data structures from primitive 
data types; specifically, we will work with integers of varying size 
representing days, months, and years. We will use them to create Arrow :class:`Arrays <Array>`
and :class:`ChunkedArrays<ChunkedArray>`, and use those to construct tabular data structures,
i.e., :class:`RecordBatch` and :class:`Table`.

Setup
=====

First, as ever, we need some includes. We'll get ``iostream`` for output, then import Arrow's basic
functionality from ``api.h``, like so: 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: Includes)
  :end-before: (Doc section: Includes)

Next, we need a ``main()`` – a common pattern with Arrow looks like the
following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: Main)
  :end-before: (Doc section: Main)

This allows us to easily use Arrow’s error-handling macros, which will
return back to ``main()`` with a :class:`arrow::Status` object if a failure occurs – and
this ``main()`` will report the error. Note that this means Arrow never
raises exceptions, instead relying upon returning :class:`Status`. For more on
that, read here: <LINK TO CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW>

To accompany this ``main()``, we have a ``RunMain()`` from which any :class:`Status`
objects can return – this is where we’ll write the rest of the program:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: RunMain Start)
  :end-before: (Doc section: RunMain Start)


Making an Arrow Array
=====================

We want to get the data from an array in standard C++ into an
Arrow array. We still guarantee contiguity of memory in an :class:`Array`, so no
worries about a performance loss when using :class:`Array` vs C++ arrays.
The easiest way to construct an :class:`Array` uses an :class:`ArrayBuilder`. <RST
NOTE NEAR HERE: for more technical details, check out…> The following
code initializes an :class:`ArrayBuilder` for an :class:`Array` that will hold 8 bit
integers, and uses the ``AppendValues()`` method, present in concrete 
:class:`arrow::ArrayBuilder` subclasses, to fill it with the
contents of a standard C++ array. Note the use of :c:macro:`ARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK`.
If ``AppendValues()`` fails, this macro will return to ``main()``, which will
print out the meaning of the failure.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: int8builder 1 Append)
  :end-before: (Doc section: int8builder 1 Append)

Once an :class:`ArrayBuilder` has the values we want in our :class:`Array`, we can use 
:func:`ArrayBuilder::Finish` to output the final structure to an :class:`Array` – specifically, 
we output to a ``std::shared_ptr<arrow::Array>``. Note the use of :c:macro:`ARROW_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE`
in the following code. :func:`~ArrayBuilder::Finish` outputs a :class:`arrow::Result` object, which :c:macro:`ARROW_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE` 
can process. If the method fails, it will return to ``main()`` with a :class:`Status`
that will explain what went wrong. If it succeeds, then it will assign
the final output to the left-hand variable.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: int8builder 1 Finish)
  :end-before: (Doc section: int8builder 1 Finish)

Once an :class:`ArrayBuilder` has had its :func:`Finish <ArrayBuilder::Finish>` method called, its state resets, so
it can be used again, like so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: int8builder 2)
  :end-before: (Doc section: int8builder 2)

However, an :class:`ArrayBuilder` cannot have its type changed in the middle of its
use – we have to make a new one when we switch to year data, which
requires a 16-bit integer at the minimum. Of course, there’s an :class:`ArrayBuilder`
for that:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: int16builder)
  :end-before: (Doc section: int16builder)

Now, we have three Arrow :class:`Arrays <arrow::Array>`, with some variance in type.

Making a RecordBatch
====================

A columnar data format only really comes into play when you have a table. 
So, let’s make one. The first kind we’ll make is the :class:`RecordBatch` – this 
uses :class:`Arrays <Array>` internally, which means all data will be contiguous within each 
column, but any appending or concatenating will require copying.

To get started making a :class:`RecordBatch`, we first need to define
characteristics of the columns, each represented by a :class:`Field` instance.
Each :class:`Field` contains a name and datatype for its associated column; then,
a :class:`Schema` groups them together and sets the order of the columns, like
so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: Schema)
  :end-before: (Doc section: Schema)

With data in :class:`Arrays <Array>` and column descriptions in our :class:`Schema`, we can make
the :class:`RecordBatch`. Note that the length of the columns is necessary, and
the length is shared by all columns.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: RBatch)
  :end-before: (Doc section: RBatch)

Now, we have our data in a nice tabular form, safely within the :class:`RecordBatch`.

Making a Table
==============

Let’s say that we want an array made up of sub-arrays, because it
can be useful for logic, for parallelizing work, for fitting each chunk
cutely into cache, or for exceeding the 2,147,483,647 row limit in a
standard Arrow :class:`Array`. For this, Arrow offers :class:`ChunkedArray`, which can be
made up of individual Arrow :class:`Arrays <Array>`. So, let’s build a few more :class:`Arrays <Array>`,
using the same builders for ease of use:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: More Arrays)
  :end-before: (Doc section: More Arrays)

Now, we can get into the magic. First, we’ll get an :class:`ArrayVector` (vector
of arrays) holding both of our day arrays:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: ArrayVector)
  :end-before: (Doc section: ArrayVector)

This doesn’t have all the features of a :class:`ChunkedArray`, so we don’t stop
here. Instead, we use it to create our :class:`ChunkedArray`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: ChunkedArray Day)
  :end-before: (Doc section: ChunkedArray Day)

Now, we have a :class:`ChunkedArray` for our day values. We’ll repeat that for
months and years:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: ChunkedArray Month Year)
  :end-before: (Doc section: ChunkedArray Month Year)

Now, we have :class:`ChunkedArrays <ChunkedArray>` which contain our newly extended data in
bite-sized chunks. A :class:`RecordBatch` is specifically for :class:`Arrays <Array>`, and its
counterpart for :class:`ChunkedArrays <ChunkedArray>` is the :class:`Table`. Its constructor is
effectively identical, it just happens to put the length of the columns
in position 3, and makes a :class:`Table`. We re-use the :class:`Schema` from before, and
make our :class:`Table`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: Table)
  :end-before: (Doc section: Table)

After that, we just return :func:`Status::OK()`, so the ``main()`` knows that
we’re done, and that everything’s okay.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../cpp/examples/tutorial_examples/arrow_example.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: Ret)
  :end-before: (Doc section: Ret)

With that, you’ve created the fundamental data structures in Arrow, and
can proceed to getting them in and out of a program with file I/O:
